Crefi is a Python command-line tool to create files for the file system
benchmarking. It provides basic operations to create files of differrent
sizes, in different layout , with other options.

Typical use involves creating large number of files of different sizes,
over different layout.

==OPTIONS

  -n FILES     number of files in each level [default: 100]

  --size=SIZE  size of the files to be used in KB.
	       By default random sizes are taken.

  --random     random size of the file between --min and --max [default: True]
	       default random sizes of the files will be between 10k and 500K.
	       both --max and --min option are used with only this option.

  --max=MAX    maximum size(KB) of the files, if random is True [default: 500]

  --min=MIN    minimum size(KB) of the files, if random is True [default: 10]

  --single     create files in single given directory [default: True]

  --multi      create files in multiple directories.
	       This option is used to create files in different directory layouts.
	       Actually there can be different types of directory layouts,
	       But right now , the tool supports rectangular layout with given
	       breadth and depth. In each directory it create -n number of files.
	       Total number of files created with muclti options will be ,
	       No of files = n * b * d

  -b BRDTH     number of directories in one level [default: 5]

  -d DEPTH     number of levels of directories [default: 5]

  -l FLEN      number of bytes for filename [default: 10].
	       First 10 bytes will be current time, next bytes will be the value
	       given. Default value will be 10 bytes. If no value is given,
	       all the filenames will be of 10+10=20 bytes.
	       Otherwise it will be (10+ l)bytes.

  --text       create text files. [default: True]

  --sparse     create sparse files.

==EXAMPLES

  ./crefi MNT_PT

	  # Create 100 text files in the directory MNT_PT of random size
	    between 10K and 500K [Filename length will be 20 bytes
	    first 10 bytes will be current time, next 10 bytes will be
	    combination of letters(A-Z) and numbers(1-9)]

  ./crefi --multi -b 10 -d 10 -n 1000 --sparse --size=100 MNT_PT

	  # Create files in directory MNT_PT in the directory
	    layout of 10 directories in each level, and 10 directories
	    depth and in each directory, create 1000 sparse files of size 100K.
